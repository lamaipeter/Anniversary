          <p><b>Happy 3 year anniversary, Babe!</b></p>
          <p>These past three years have been the most incredible journey of my life, and that's all because of you. Thank you for filling my life with so much joy, laughter, and love. You inspire me, support me, and make every day better just by being in it.
            I cherish every memory we've made and look forward to all the adventures to come. I love you more than words can say.</p>
          <p>Yours lovely<br><b>Tsawra</b></p>
